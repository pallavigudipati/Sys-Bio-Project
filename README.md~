Sys-Bio-Project
===============

###Pre-requisites
-------------------
The following utilities need to be installed:
- Matlab
- Python
- Git
- MatlabBGL

###Clone the repository
--------------------------
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pallavigudipati/Sys-Bio-Project.git
```

###Structure of the repository
--------------------------
All the code is in the code folder.
    GraphSig
        Contains all the code written corresponding to the GraphSig algorithm written in matlab
    FSG
        This contains the fsg executable and corresponding scripts


###Setup
---------
The Repository has code written to run for the STRING Databases, but the by changing the preprocessing steps approriately

The code in the repository can be 

After you get all the subgraphs from graph-cut and store them in the following form,

    * node_label1
  	    - org_1
		    - 264.csv
		    - 674.csv

    * node_label2
	    - org_1
	        - 333.csv
	    - org_2
	        - 456.csv

copy the contents of `code/FSG` in the folder that contains the above structure. Run the following command:
```bash
./run_fsg
```
You will be prompted to enter the number of nodes and the support threshold.
Final output will be stored in `final_output.txt`.

You can all view the intermediate files generated like the tid files etc. [PAFI](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/pafi/overview) was used to mine maximal subgraphs. Only the linux executable to run FSG has been provided `code/FSG/fsg`.
